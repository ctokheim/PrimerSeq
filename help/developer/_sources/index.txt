Welcome to PrimerSeq's Developer Documentation
==============================================

PrimerSeq aims to design qRT-PCR primers on appropriate flanking 
exons around your target of interest. Its aim is to design
primers for validating alternative splicing events. PrimerSeq is particularly
advantageous for designing a large number of primers for validating
alternative splicing events found in RNA-Seq data.

PrimerSeq incorporates RNA-Seq data in the design process to weight
exons by their read counts.
Essentially, the RNA-Seq data allows primers to be placed where you want them to be.
This could be for your particular cell line or experimental 
condition, rather than using annotations that incorporate transcripts
that are not expressed for your data. Alternatively, you can design
primers that are always on constitutive exons.

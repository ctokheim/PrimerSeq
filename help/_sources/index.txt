=====================

PrimerSeq aims to design RT-PCR primers on appropriate flanking 
exons around your target of interest. Its aim is to design
primers for validating alternative splicing events. PrimerSeq is particularly
advantageous for designing a large number of primers for validating
alternative splicing events found in RNA-Seq data.

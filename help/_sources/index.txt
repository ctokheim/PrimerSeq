   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to PrimerSeq!
=====================

PrimerSeq aims to design RT-PCR primers on appropriate flanking
exons around your target of interest. Its aim is to design
primers for validating alternative splicing events. PrimerSeq is particularly
advantageous for designing a large number of primers for validating differential
alternative splicing events found in RNA-Seq data.

User Documentation
==================

The PrimerSeq Graphical User Interface (GUI) consists of four main components.

1. Menu items
2. Required tab
3. Optional tab
4. Results Window

1. Menu items
-------------

The menu has several import options within three categories.

1. File
2. Edit
3. Help

1.1 File
++++++++

Load Quick Ex.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The File->Load Quick Ex. option automatically loads a single exon example data that is distributed with PrimerSeq.
For details read the `getting started <http://primerseq.sf.net/getting_started.html>`_ page.

Load Larger Ex.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The File->Load Larger Ex. option automatically loads a 10 exon example data that is distributed with PrimerSeq.
For details read the `getting started <http://primerseq.sf.net/getting_started.html>`_ page.

Reset
~~~~~

The File->Reset option resets PrimerSeq in case an error occurs during running.

Quit
~~~~

The File->Quit option closes PrimerSeq.

1.2 Edit
++++++++

Primer3
~~~~~~~

The Edit->Primer3 option opens a configuration file for Primer3 called primer3.txt. For information on
editing Primer3 parameters please see their `manual <../primer3/primer3_manual.htm>`_.

Primer3 Location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Edit->"Primer3 Location" option opens the following dialog that allows you to specify where primer3
and a primer3 configuration file is located. This functionality is useful if you wish to use your own
installed primer3 or have several configuration files. To view your current primer3 configuration file
press Edit->Primer3.

Sort GTF & Add Genes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For more information about these options, please refer to the `GTF documentation <http://primerseq.sf.net/gtf.html>`_.

1.3 Help
++++++++

Help
~~~~

Opens this HTML page in the default webbrowser.


Primer3 Doc.
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Opens the manual for Primer3. The Primer3 manual is a good resource for understanding how to edit primer design parameters found in the text file opened by Edit->Primer3.

2. Required tab
---------------

The required tab consists of input that must be filled in before PrimerSeq can design
primers. The required input is as follows:

1. Genome sequence (FASTA)
2. Gene annotation (GTF)
3. Mapped reads (SAM/BAM(s))
4. Target exon(s)
5. Output file

.. image:: required.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

2.1 Genome sequence (FASTA)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Genome sequences are only allowed in FASTA format. Use FASTA files that contain the entire genome
sequence for a species to avoid problems. You can obtain the Human and Mouse genome from the following
links:

* `hg19 <http://mimg.ucla.edu/faculty/xing/public_data/PrimerSeq/hg19.fa.gz>`_
* `mm9 <http://mimg.ucla.edu/faculty/xing/public_data/PrimerSeq/mm9.fa.gz>`_

The first time you load a FASTA file may take several minutes. Subsequent loading will occur instantly.

2.2 Gene annotation (GTF)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

PrimerSeq uses gene annotation in GTF format. Ultimately, the choice of where you obtain the GTF is up to you. You could download GTFs known to work from the PrimerSeq sourceforge website, download GTFs from UCSC or Ensembl, or use GTF output from transcript assemblers like Cufflinks. For ease of use, GTFs for human and mouse are provided. UCSC's known gene annotation is preferred over Ensembl.

* `UCSC Human (hg19) <http://sourceforge.net/projects/primerseq/files/GTF/Homo_sapiens.knownGene.hg19.sorted.withGenes.gtf.gz/download>`_
* `Ensembl Human (hg19) <http://sourceforge.net/projects/primerseq/files/GTF/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.69.sorted.gtf.gz/download>`_
* `UCSC Mouse (mm9) <http://sourceforge.net/projects/primerseq/files/GTF/Mus_musculus.knownGene.mm9.sorted.withGenes.gtf.gz/download>`_
* `Ensembl Mouse (mm9) <http://sourceforge.net/projects/primerseq/files/GTF/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.69.sorted.gtf.gz/download>`_

You can also mix several GTF files into a single input GTF file for PrimerSeq! For more detailed explanations please click `here <http://primerseq.sourceforge.net/gtf.html>`_.

2.3 Mapped reads (SAM/BAM(s))
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can specify none, one or multiple SAM/BAM files as input. Make sure to hold down the ctrl key to select multiple files. SAM/BAM files are the typical output format from read aligners like Tophat. The SAM/BAM file allows PrimerSeq to estimate the relative abundance of different isoforms. If you know your BAM file is sorted (like the output from Tophat) then please name the BAM file with a **.sorted.bam** extension so PrimerSeq does not try to re-sort the file.

2.4 Target exon(s)
++++++++++++++++++

Enter target coordinates as (strand)chr:start-end. The first nucleotide on a chromosome is at position 0. The end position is not inclusive.

If you wish PrimerSeq to automatically find flanking exons then only specify a list of target exons where each exon is specified on a different line.

-chr18:9562919-9563044

However, you may also specify the flanking exons for primer design. Follow the following convention to do this:

targetExon1,upstreamExon1,downstreamExon1
targetExon2,upstreamExon2,downstreamExon2

The target exon is followed by upstream flanking exon and then by the downstream flanking exon (separated by a comma).
Remember to follow the same coordinate format for just the target exon case.

2.5 Output file
+++++++++++++++

PrimerSeq saves results to the text file you specify immediately after primer design is finished.

3. Optional tab
---------------

.. image:: optional.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

* **Minimum Flanking PSI:** minimum inclusion level where a primer is allowed to be placed on that exon
* **Splice Junction:** source for defining exon junctions
* **Gene ID:** flag for whether the GTF has a valid Gene ID
* **Keep Temporary:** flag for keeping temporary files created when running PrimerSeq
* **Read Threshold:** minimum read count necessary to define a novel junction from RNA-Seq
* **Anchor Length:** minimum number of bases on both sides of a junction for a read to be considered valid
* **Min. Jct Count:** assign at least this number of reads to a junction known in the GTF annotation

4. Results Window
-----------------

.. image:: display_results.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

The results window allows you to plot the results of primer design and check for unintended product
amplification using UCSC's In-Silico PCR.  There are
several buttons, starting from the left they are:

  1. "*Create Plots*" - Create a single plot displaying primer design (see below)
  2. "*In-Silico PCR*" - Automatically links to UCSCS's *in-silico* PCR result (see below)
  3. "*Save Plots*" - Save all plots and *in-silico* PCR links as a web page (HTML)
  4. "*Evaluate AS Events*" - Plot the Alternative Splicing event structure using pooled data
  5. "*Reset Values*" - Re-fills in values if user accidently makes edits
  6. "*Help*" - Briefly describes the above buttons
  7. "*Exit*" - Exits the results window

For information on producing the below results, please see the
`getting started <http://primerseq.sf.net/getting_started.html>`_ page. The `user tutorial <http://primerseq.sf.net/user_tutorial>`_ has additional documentation describing more advanced features.
